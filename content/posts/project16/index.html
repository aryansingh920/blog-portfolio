    <h2>Preprocessing</h2>
    <p>
        Preprocessing is a critical step in preparing raw data for training and evaluation. This project implements
        advanced preprocessing techniques to ensure the model is fed with clean, consistent, and optimized inputs.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Image Resizing:</strong> Input images are resized to a fixed dimension, ensuring uniformity across
            the dataset.</li>
        <li><strong>Normalization:</strong> Pixel values are scaled to a range of 0 to 1 to improve model convergence
            during training.</li>
        <li><strong>Augmentation:</strong> Techniques such as rotation, flipping, and brightness adjustments are applied
            to enhance robustness against real-world variations.</li>

    <h2>Data Conversion: COCO and YOLO Formats</h2>
    <p>
        Proper data formatting is crucial for training object detection models. This project involves converting
        annotations into two widely used formats: COCO and YOLO. Each format has specific requirements that facilitate
        compatibility with their respective frameworks.
    </p>

    <h3>Conversion to COCO Format</h3>
    <p>
        The COCO (Common Objects in Context) format is a versatile and detailed annotation format. It supports multiple
        object categories, segmentation masks, and keypoints for tasks like object detection and image segmentation. The
        conversion process involves:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Standardizing annotations into the COCO JSON structure.</li>
        <li>Mapping object categories and bounding box coordinates.</li>
        <li>Ensuring compatibility with COCO evaluation metrics.</li>
    </ul>
    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9106252/37988554-1a3015fe-31f9-11e8-8eb6-21b0d462900c.png"
        alt="COCO Annotation Format Example" />

    <h3>Conversion to YOLO Format</h3>
    <p>
        The YOLO (You Only Look Once) format is optimized for real-time object detection. Its simplicity lies in using
        plain text files where each line represents an object annotation. Conversion steps include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Normalizing bounding box coordinates relative to image dimensions.</li>
        <li>Assigning object class IDs based on a predefined label map.</li>
        <li>Creating individual annotation files for each image.</li>
    </ul>
    <img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1114/1*aDCMw6f3MvyyoDhHejohwQ.png"
        alt="YOLO Annotation Format Example" />

    <p>
        By supporting both COCO and YOLO formats, the project ensures compatibility with a variety of object detection
        frameworks and simplifies model training workflows.
    </p>

    <h2>Validation</h2>
    <p>
        Validation is a critical step in evaluating the performance of the object detection model. It ensures that the
        model generalizes well to unseen data and identifies potential issues such as overfitting or underfitting. This
        project employs robust validation techniques to assess accuracy and reliability.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Dataset Split:</strong> The dataset is divided into training (80%) and validation (20%) subsets to
            evaluate performance on unseen data.</li>
        <li><strong>Metrics:</strong> Common evaluation metrics include mAP (mean Average Precision), IoU (Intersection
            over Union), and precision-recall curves.</li>
        <li><strong>Visualization:</strong> Predicted bounding boxes and confidence scores are compared against ground
            truth annotations to visually inspect model accuracy.</li>
        <li><strong>Early Stopping:</strong> Monitors validation loss to prevent overfitting by halting training when
            performance stagnates or deteriorates.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Below is an example of a validation image showcasing predicted bounding boxes and their corresponding labels:

            optimal performance.</li>
        <li><strong>Augmentation:</strong> Real-time data augmentation is applied, including random cropping, flipping,
            and brightness adjustments, to improve model robustness.</li>
        <li><strong>Loss Functions:</strong> YOLOv8 uses a combination of localization loss (IoU-based), confidence
            loss, and classification loss to guide training.</li>
        <li><strong>Training Pipeline:</strong> The model is trained on GPUs, leveraging frameworks like PyTorch for
            efficient computation. Early stopping and learning rate schedulers are employed to fine-tune performance.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Evaluation During Training</h3>

        alt="Correlation Histogram of Predictions During Training" />

    <h3>4. Challenges and Solutions</h3>
    <p>
        Training object detection models on complex datasets like KITTI presents several challenges:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Class Imbalance:</strong> Certain classes (e.g., pedestrians or cyclists) may be underrepresented.
            This is mitigated using class-specific weighting during loss calculation.</li>
        <li><strong>Overfitting:</strong> Addressed using techniques like dropout layers, data augmentation, and early
            stopping.</li>
        <li><strong>Computational Load:</strong> Leveraging distributed training and mixed-precision computation reduces
            GPU memory usage and training time.</li>
    </ul>
